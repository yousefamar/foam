Yousef was attentive and asked the right questions to get a sense of what I needed out of the mentorship session I'd with him. He took his time to go through my CV and pointed out things I could do to improve the result I was already getting. After making the changes, Yousef asked that I send it to him and he still took another look at it and make some adjustments. Yousef shared with me a great number of resources and he introduced me to websites which will aid me in my job search and increase my chances of getting interviews. He carefully walked me through how I can write a good cover letter. I'd highly recommend Yousef to anyone."
